vgchartzfull is a python script based on BeautifulSoup.
It creates a dataset based on data from 
http://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/

The dataset is saved as vgsales.csv.

You will need to have BeautifulSoup added.
It can be installed by pip.

sudo pip install BeautifulSoup

You also need to install pandas, time, and glob.
